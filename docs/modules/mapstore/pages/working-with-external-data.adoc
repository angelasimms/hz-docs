= Building a Cache with MapStore
:description: MapStore is an API for building a cache on top of Hazelcast. To build a cache, you can either use a pre-built component, which requires little or no coding. Or, you can use a custom option that allows you to write the interface yourself.

== MapLoader or MapStore

You can use either the `MapLoader` or `Mapstore` interfaces to set up a cache, depending on your use case.

MapLoader allows you to connect to a data store and load data from it into your cluster. For example, you can use a MapLoader to load data into your cluster from a MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL database. MapLoader supports read-through caching only.

MapStore extends this functionality. It loads data but also writes data back to the data store to keep it synchronized with data on your cluster. MapStore supports all of the following caching patterns: read-through, write-through, write-behind.

Both interfaces include methods that are triggered when operations are invoked on a map.

== Supported Caching Patterns

- Read-through (always): If an entry does not exist in memory when an application asks for it, Hazelcast asks the MapLoader/MapStore implementation to load that entry from the data store. If the entry exists, the MapLoader/MapStore implementation requests it from the data store and Hazelcast puts it into memory.

- Write-through (default): When new entries are added to a map, those entries are added to the data store synchronously.

- Write-behind (requires xref:configuration-guide.adoc#write-behind[configuration]): When new entries are added to a map, those entries are added to the data store asynchronously, after a configured delay.

== Options for Building a MapStore

To build a cache, you can either use a pre-built, generic MapLoader or MapStore that comes with Hazelcast. This option requires you to write little to no Java code. Or, you can write a custom implementation using the `MapLoader` or `MapStore` interfaces.

[[low-code]]
=== Generic MapLoader or MapStore

The xref:mapstore:configuring-a-generic-maploader.adoc[generic MapLoader] and xref:mapstore:configuring-a-generic-mapstore.adoc[generic MapStore] connect to an external data store  using the xref:external-data-stores:external-data-stores.adoc[`external-data-store` configuration].

- If Hazelcast provides a built-in xref:external-data-stores:external-data-stores.adoc#factories[data store factory] for your data store, you can configure your cluster to use it, without writing any Java code.
- If a built-in data store factory is not available, you can write your own in Java to allow the generic MapLoader or MapStore to connect to your data store.

[[custom]]
=== Custom MapStore

If you need full control over how your cache works, xref:mapstore:implement-a-mapstore.adoc[implement your own in Java]. The connection to the data store is handled in your MapStore implementation.
