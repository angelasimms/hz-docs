= Connecting to the SQL Service
:description: You can connect to the SQL service of a Hazelcast member using a shell, a client API, or Management Center.

== Before you Begin

To use the SQL service, the Jet engine must be enabled on the cluster. For information about how to enable the Jet engine, see xref:pipelines:job-security.adoc[].

== Connection Options

You can connect to the SQL service of a Hazelcast member using one of the following options:

- <<sql-shell, SQL shell>> or xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:ROOT:sql-browser.adoc[Management Center]: For fast prototyping.

NOTE: You cannot run SQL queries on xref:ROOT:glossary.adoc#lite-member[lite members]. This limitation will be removed in future releases.

== Using the SQL Shell

The easiest way to run SQL queries on a cluster is to connect to the SQL shell.

To connect to the SQL shell, run the `hz-cli sql` command of your member's built-in CLI.

Replace the `$LOCAL_IP` placeholder with your member's local IP address.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --network hazelcast-network -it --rm hazelcast/hazelcast:{full-version} hz-cli --targets hello-world@$LOCAL_IP sql
----

The `--targets` parameter tells the SQL shell to connect to the member at the given IP address in a cluster called `hello-world`.
